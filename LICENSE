The software Meowencrypt is licensed under GPL-3.0 (GNU General Public License 3.0) and LGPL-3.0 (GNU Lesser General

All the codes under meowencrypt/enclib are licensed under LGPL-3.0, while the rest of the program is licensed under
GPL-3.0.

The purpose for using different licenses for different parts of this software is because codes in folder
meowencrypt/enclib may be used in other independent projects. These codes implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange
algorithm and multi-session key support that might be useful in other scenarios. GNU GPL is a strong copyleft license
that may, in my opinion, hinders the free-software development when other programmers founded that their work must be
open-sourced under GPL, which they may not intended to do so.

As a programming hobbyist, I hope I could respect users' and developers' freedom. While GNU GPL ensures freedom for all
entities, it does not ensure the software is fully utilized and disseminated.
