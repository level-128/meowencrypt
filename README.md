## Background

Meowencrypt is real-time end-to-end encryption software on Microsoft Windows platform. It encrypts your 
message into printable characters, allowing users to send encrypted message through 
public or unsafe environment: for example, some instant messenger application provides no security measures, 
or provides end-to-end encryption between the user and the server, rather than user to user, allowing companies
and government to monitor users for commercial promotion or political censorship. 

The password will be generated per-session, and you __CAN NOT__ export the key or save the state when the 
session has terminated, which means if you close the application or terminate the session, you can't decrypt
__ANY__ message.


## Install

On Microsoft Windows, download the [Windows installation package]() and complete the installation wizard. 
Meowencrypt does not support any other operating systems (yet).
